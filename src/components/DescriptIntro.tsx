        I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Alberta (Spring 2025), with a passion for building systems that connect hardware and software. I’m especially interested in technologies that drive real-world impact. Outside of engineering, I’m into personal finance, playing guitar, training MMA, and hitting the golf course when I can. Whether I’m debugging code or working on my swing, I love tackling challenges and constantly learning.
